# Data Science Projects

This repository contains my groovy work with data science projects. Feel free to suggest improvements!

## Chess 

In this project, I use basic machine learning techniques to predict results of Lichess.org matches. Check out the html file or jupyter notebook file for chess_project in the version_one folder. 

## Chernobyl Air 

In this project, I use geographic python packages to visualize nuclear fallout air concentrations after the nuclear 
explosion near Chernobyl, Ukraine in 1986. Your adventure will begin when you check out the html file or jupyter notebook file for chernobyl_project in the version_one folder.
